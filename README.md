### Final Independent Project, 3.12.2020

### Created by Lisa Garvey

### Project Description

Create a website that allows a user to input a number and see a string of numerical and word display.

### Specifications

All output will be numerical with the following exceptions:
Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced with "Beep!"; 
Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced with "Boop!" or 
Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

Additionally, the highest number should be evaluated for use (ie: if the user enters a 13, the output should be "Won't you be my neighbor?")

Result when a number is entered like 3: 0, 1, 2, 3
